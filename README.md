# Heat Control System
# Introduction
The primary goal of Heat control system is to provide passenger comfort in as quick as possible. A developer should develop a circuit in such a way that it should work properly in extream temperature conditions. This project is designed to control the temperature of a car seat if a passenger or driver is seated. When passengers or driver of the car gets seated on a car, the button sensor gets activate after that heater enabled. Here The temperarure sensor keeps track of the temperature and sends value of temperature to the microcontroller. This project is built using atmega328 microcontroller, temperature sensor, USART Display, ADC to convert analog value to digital value.
